Dalla Costa points out that what the housewife produces in the family are not simply use-values but the commodity ‘labour power’ which the husband then can sell as a ‘free’ wage labourer in the labour market. She clearly states that the productivity of the housewife is the precondition for the productivity of the (male) wage labourer. The nuclear family, organized and protected by the state, is the social factory where this commodity ‘labour power’ is produced. Hence, the housewife and her labour are not outside the process of surplus value production, but constitute the very foundation upon which this process can get started. The housewife and her labour are, in other words, the basis of the process of capital accumulation. With the help of the state and its legal machinery women have been shut up in the isolated nuclear family, whereby their work there was made socially invisible, and was hence defined - by Marxist and non-Marxist theoreticians - as ‘non-productive’.

Much like the concept of “species”, it’s a model, and no model is an actuality - then it would not be a model, it would be a fact. </p>\n<p>In truth sexual characteristics are diverse and varied and do not always match up with sex chromosomes; also, a sexual “binary” of sorts is not constant amongst all living things, and most organisms have other systems of reproduction. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, gender is the suite of societally-defined social roles and behavioral characteristics that is typically assigned based on the externally perceived sex of a child; and does not actually have anything to do with biology - even less so than sex. Even though it is assigned based on this externally perceived sex, a person’s gender does not have to remain with the one assigned; much as we don’t determine people’s careers based on who their parents were anymore, your birth has no limitation on who you are and what gender identity you construct for yourself. Since it is a societally defined construct, people can and do construct more than the two traditional ones, and all are valid. </p>\n<p>Just because you cannot handle your societally constructed worldview surrounding sex, gender, and genetics being dismantled by sociology &amp; biology itself doesn’t mean, additionally, that you have the right to make other people feel unsafe and uncomfortable - in short, that you have the right to remove people from moral consideration - simply because you don’t like having your world view being dismantled. Believe it or not, the complexities of human behavior &amp; the diversity of sex and reproduction in life cannot all be covered in a simple high school biology class. </p>\n<p>So next time you want to say “didn’t you pass biology” remember: a biology PhD student, who graduated from the University of Notre Dame with an actual degree in Biological Sciences, has reminded you that you’re wrong. </p>\n<p>There are more than two genders. </p>\n<p>The end. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sex is biological tough… It’s not a social construct… It’s not time, racism etc. It’s a physics attribute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why are you trying to argue with someone who said species is a constructed model and not a fact? You’re not going to change someone’s mind when they’re that far down the rabbit hole</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Me: Spends 6 years intensely studying biological science and evolution at two major universities with widespread academic acclaim, earning honors and high GPAs and am currently working on a PhD in the subject of biodiversity and evolution </p>\n<p>You: Somehow thinks they know more because you took a couple of classes</p>\n<p>Lol</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>…Buddy. Buddy. <i>Dude</i>. I really don’t think you want to open this can of worms.</p>\n<p>I mean, I know that in school they teach you a very clean, concise, definitive way of doing things and you’ve probably learnt something like <i>the definition of a species is a population of organisms that are able to reproduce and produce viable offspring</i>, or something. But I mean literally anyone who has done even undergrad biology can tell you that that statement is <i>incredibly</i> reductive and incredibly controversial in the scientific community [<a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf\">1</a>][<a href=\"http://evolution.powernet.ru/library/Scienc6.pdf\">2</a>]. In fact, you probably don’t even need a background in biology to spot the obvious flaw in the logic there, which is the fact that organisms classified as different species <i>do</i> reproduce and produce viable offspring. Quite a lot, actually. Lions and tigers (<i>Panthera leo</i> and <i>P. tigris</i>), coyotes and grey wolves (<i>Canis latrans</i> and <i>C. lupus</i>)… In fact, there’s even a word for new species arising through hybridisation between existing species - hybrid speciation [<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7133/full/nature05706.html\">3</a>]. The great skua (<i>Stercorarius skua</i>) is believed to be an example of this in animals [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1688246/pdf/9061968.pdf\">4</a>], and another interesting one that may be pretty much hybrid speciation in action (though not nearly anything that can be called a new distinct species yet) is the so-called “Eastern coyote”, a population of wild coyotes in the eastern US that are mixed with grey wolf and domestic dog, and can contain as much as 40% non-coyote DNA [<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/yes-eastern-coyotes-are-hybrids-but-the-coywolf-is-not-a-thing-50368\">5</a>]. </p>\n<p>And, in fact, the ability of two organisms to reproduce and produce viable offspring actually has very little with how we choose to classify them, because evolutionary and genetic relationships are rarely that simple. For example, some species that are the same genus - e.g. horses (<i>Equus ferus</i>) and donkeys (<i>Equus africanus</i>) can interbreed, but their offspring are usually sterile [<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061129150811.htm\">6</a>], while other species that are <i>different genera</i> to each other can interbreed to produce intergeneric hybrids, some of which are even fertile (for example crosses between false killer whales (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>) and bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7508288/#.V61oHCh97IU\">7</a>], or between king snakes (genus <i>Lampropeltis</i>) and corn snakes (genus <i>Pantherophis</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Snake-Hybridization-A-Case-for-Intrabaraminic-Diversity.pdf\">8</a>]). Most “exotic” domestic cat breeds (e.g. Bengals and Savannahs) also fall into this category - for some reason felids are genetically Weird in that a wide variety of species in the family Felidae seem able to interbreed with each other, no matter how different or distantly related they are. I mean…</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"652\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/de9535995ecf113b98b77bca695462ef/tumblr_inline_obpkn2oSZQ1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"652\"/></figure><p><br/></p>\n<p>Look at this shit. Now bear in mind that the domestic cat (<i>Felis catus</i>) is known to be able to interbreed with species in the caracal, ocelot, lynx and leopard cat lineages in addition to those in its own lineage, and if that wasn’t bad enough <i>puma/leopard hybrids</i> are a thing that exist. Those species aren’t even in the same <i>subfamily</i>, let alone genus or genetic lineage - the leopard is classed as subfamily Pantherinae, genus <i>Panthera </i>(<i>P. pardus</i>) while the puma is classed as subfamily Felinae, genus <i>Puma </i>(<i>P. concolor</i>). </p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"2360\" data-orig-height=\"2355\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/6dd98a0cb8cc8ff174af16511371bbb4/tumblr_inline_obs9ruY31B1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2360\" data-orig-height=\"2355\"/></figure><p>[<a href=\"http://messybeast.com/small-hybrids/hybrids.htm\">9</a>]</p>\n<p>Although these aren’t even the most distantly related species that are able to interbreed - domestic chickens (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) are known to hybridise with guineafowl [<a href=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/nvj/article/viewFile/3595/38131\">10</a>], and the offspring of these crosses are interfamilial hybrids since chickens and guineafowl are classified in different families (chickens belong to family Phasianidae, guineafowl to family Numididae).</p>\n<p>And of course another place where the “able to interbreed and produce viable offspring” definition falls apart is with organisms that reproduce asexually or without the need for a sexual partner, which is even more complicated when you consider that some species (for example, some species in the paraphyletic whiptail lizard genus <i>Cnemidophorus</i>) are<i> </i>dioecious, meaning they have separate sexes, and reproduce by producing gametes via meiosis, but have actually lost the ability to reproduce sexually somewhere along the evolutionary line - these species reproduce predominantly or entirely by parthenogenesis (essentially a form of self-cloning) and the Y chromosome has been entirely lost in the population. This also ties into hybrid speciation because it is believed that these parthenogenic species arose from hybridisation between two or three sexual species [<a href=\"http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/3369\">11</a>][<a href=\"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3099/MCZ17.1\">12</a>], leading to polyploid individuals (i.e. those with ‘extra’ sets of chromosomes) - for example, the all-female parthenogenic species <i>Cnemidophorus neomexicanus</i> is actually a hybrid of two sexual species, <i>Cnemidophorus inornatus</i> and<i> C. marmoratus </i>(or <i>C. tigris</i>, according to Wikipedia), and thus new individuals of this species can be formed either by parthenogenesis in a single <i>C. neomexicanus</i> parent, or sexual reproduction between a male and female <i>C. inornatus</i> and <i>C. marmoratus</i>/<i>C. tigris </i>[<a href=\"http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/handle/2246/5187//v2/dspace/ingest/pdfSource/nov/N2905.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">13</a>]. Some female parthenogenic species are also able to interbreed sexually with males from sexual species, resulting in hybrids which may or may not also be parthenogenic [<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1442858.pdf\">14</a>].</p>\n<p>So you can ask, well what the fuck is a genus, or a species for that matter, if it doesn’t necessarily indicate whether two animals are genetically similar enough to interbreed or not? And, more to the point, is there a strict set of quantitative criteria that defines whether two populations of organisms are classified as the same or different species? And I mentioned speciation, which brings up the question, when exactly in the process of evolution does one species actually become another?</p>\n<p>The thing is, there aren’t actually definitive answers to these questions - if you ask a bunch of biologists what a species is, it’s likely you’ll get different answers. “Species” also has a number of definitions [<a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/10/01/a-list-of-26-species-concepts/\">15</a>][<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl_1/6600.full\">16</a>], mainly depending on the type of organism being studied and the angle it is being studied from. For bacteria, for instance - where “similar enough to reproduce” really isn’t applicable - I think the general consensus is that individuals are grouped together if their genetic similarity to one another is 97-98% or higher, while a similar definition of “organisms that are highly genetically similar to one another” tends to be used for asexually reproducing organisms such as some plants, and parthenogenic animals like whiptail lizards or Bdelloid rotifers (which does of course raise the question of what exactly “highly similar” means - any decided-upon cutoff point will necessarily be somewhat arbitrary). Such groupings of organisms may be referred to as <i>phylotypes</i> to distinguish them from the reproductive definition of a “species” [<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-11274-4_1210\">17</a>]. Likewise, a lot of ecological writing will define species and speciation according to <i>reproductive isolation</i>, which isn’t necessarily synonymous with reproductive compatibility - reproductively isolated populations may be genetically able to reproduce, but be prevented from doing so or unlikely to do naturally so due to differences in geographical location, habitat or behaviour (think lions and tigers). These are some of the many different “types” of species, with either competing or overlapping definitions of what exactly constitutes a species in each case:</p>\n<ul><li>Morphological or typological species (morphospecies)<br/></li>\n<li>Phylogenetic species<br/></li>\n<li>Evolutionary species<br/></li>\n<li>Genetic species<br/></li>\n<li>Genalogical concordance species</li>\n<li>Reproductive species<br/></li>\n<li>Autapomorphic species</li>\n<li>Ecological species<br/></li>\n<li>Recognition species<br/></li>\n<li>Phenetic species<br/></li>\n<li>Isolation species</li>\n<li>Cohesion species</li>\n</ul><p>…You get the idea.</p>\n<p>For vertebrates, I <i>think</i> generally the two most used definitions are the biological species concept (BSC) and phylogenetic or cladistic species concept (PSC), which differ in their criteria for what they consider a species [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871894/\">18</a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2620362/\">19</a>]. PSC, for example, doesn’t include a subspecies category while BSC does - and thus, some organisms that are classified as subspecies of the same species under BSC are either classified as different species or are lumped together as the same species under PSC. For example, grey wolves and domestic dogs. The domestic dog is/was often considered a separate species to the grey wolf, for obvious (morphological/behavioural) reasons - the wolf was <i>Canis lupus</i>, the dog <i>C. familiaris</i> - but since dogs are descended from wolves (a now-extinct lineage of wolves, not modern grey wolves [<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(15)00432-7\">20</a>], but <i>Canis lupus</i> nonetheless) they are more properly classified as a subspecies, <i>C. l. familiaris</i>. Likewise, having also ultimately descended from wolves, the dingo is officially classified as <i>C. l. dingo</i>, although there is some debate about that - at one stage I remember it being classified as a “subspecies” of domestic dog, <i>Canis lupus familiaris dingo </i>(and it’s still, to my knowledge, widely considered to be descended from domestic dogs [<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2009/10/10/what-a-dingo-is/\">21</a>][<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC514485/\">22</a>], in which case the second name would be more correct), while still other people classify it as a completely separate species, <i>Canis dingo </i>[<a href=\"http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2014/04/dingo-declared-a-separate-species\">23</a>]. You can see why species boundaries and definitions can get murky, especially when the exact evolutionary origins of a particular animal are unknown or hotly contested.</p>\n<p>In fact, canids as a whole are kind of a mess when it comes to phylogeny. How many species of wolf there are really depends on who you ask - some populations traditionally classified as subspecies of the grey wolf, for example the Indian wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. pallipes</i>), the Himalayan or Tibetan wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. chanco</i>) and the Eastern wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. lycaon</i>) have been suggested instead to be classified as separate species - <i>Canis indica</i>, <i>Canis himalayensis</i> and <i>Canis lycaon</i>, respectively [<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0469.2006.00400.x/abstract\">24</a>][<a href=\"http://redwolves.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/14-Kyle-et-al.-2006.pdf\">25</a>]. Likewise, just last year it was discovered that what was thought to be an African subspecies of the golden jackal (<i>Canis aureus</i>) had in fact been misidentified and was instead an undiscovered species of wolf, now the African golden wolf (<i>Canis anthus</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15899/20150808/meet-african-golden-wolf-new-canine-disovered-150-years.htm\">26</a>]. And then there’s also the fact that, despite being called “jackals”, the black-backed and side-striped jackals actually aren’t very closely related to the golden jackal, or indeed to any of the rest of the genus <i>Canis </i>[<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2012/08/23/jackal-is-a-meaningless-term/\">27</a>]. In fact, going by the cladogram below, you can see that the African wild dog and dhole - both of which are classed in their own, unique genera (<i>Lycaon</i> and <i>Cuon</i>, respectively) - are actually placed closer to wolves, golden jackals and coyotes than black-backed and side-striped jackals are, even though both of the latter species are considered part of genus <i>Canis </i>(the black-backed jackal is <i>C. mesomelas </i>and the side-striped is <i>C. adustus</i>). Many sources also say that these two species differ from the rest of the group in that they have only 74 chromosomes, while wolves, coyotes, golden jackals, African wild dogs and dholes all have 78. This makes the moniker of genus <i>Canis</i> somewhat useless when trying to determine exactly how genetically similar these animals actually are to one another.</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"769\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42e653087c3a0398d7b1e64ad8677e8d/tumblr_inline_obpmdqc3hg1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"769\"/></figure><p>[<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2012/02/04/canis-is-a-paraphyletic-genus/\">28</a>]</p>\n<p>And this isn’t even touching the issue of the “red wolf” (<i>Canis rufus</i>), a critically endangered so-called “species” of wolf closely related to the grey wolf, eastern wolf and coyote, which more recent molecular and genetic analysis has revealed may simply be a wolf/coyote hybrid [<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149496/\">29</a>]. Of course these classifications aren’t set in stone, either - new studies and discoveries are constantly uprooting and rewriting our knowledge of phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships among species. Sometimes it’s also pretty much impossible to accurately represent the relationships between similar-but-distinct populations using only the terms “genus” and “species”, which is where alternate concepts like <i>species complex</i>, <i>subgenus</i> and <i>superspecies</i> come in.<br/></p>\n<p>Another feature of evolution and speciation that makes classification difficult is what are known as <i>ring species</i>, in which a series of neighbouring populations of organisms may evolve divergently (i.e. undergo allopatric speciation) in such a way that each geographically adjacent or overlapping population can interbreed with the next, but the last population in the “ring” has diverged to the point that it can no longer interbreed with the first (basically, population A can interbreed with population B, B with C and C with D, but D can no longer interbreed with A). </p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"381\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6bcdff677111dc807428b85bb5768a4b/tumblr_inline_obpn0gvrtx1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"381\"/></figure><p>[<a href=\"http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/Evolution_GIST_2013/files_2013/articles/Irwin%20et%20al.%20-%202005%20-%20Speciation%20by%20distance%20in%20a%20ring%20species.pdf\">30</a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612659/\">31</a>]</p>\n<p>When does the actual split occur, and at what point in the ring can we consider the populations to be different species? We just don’t know. (And in some cases this is considerably more messy and complicated than even the ring species model makes it seem [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691675/\">32</a>]). The point is, though, that there is no definitive, universally agreed-upon cutoff point at which we can say with certainty that two organisms have evolved sufficiently as to become different species, any more than you can definitively say where along a rainbow spectrum of colours red becomes orange or orange becomes yellow. The decision whether to lump or split taxa becomes even more arbitrary in paleontology than it is with extant species [<a href=\"http://waxing-paleontological.blogspot.co.za/2014/10/taxonomic-messes.html\">33</a>][<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1301061.pdf?_=1470986977789\">34</a>] - when you’re working with an incomplete fossil record and pretty much going entirely on morphological similarities since genetic or molecular analysis often isn’t possible, there isn’t really a way to conclusively determine whether that specimen you found represents a new species, a new genus, or is simply a larger/smaller/juvenile/unfortunate-looking version of an already-described animal. Many specimens now believed to be juveniles of previously-described species were originally believed to be completely new ones - for example, Nanotyrannus is now often (but not universally) agreed to be a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex [<a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/witmerl/Downloads/2010_Witmer_&amp;_Ridgely_Cleveland_tyrannosaur.pdf\">35</a>], and Dracorex and Stygimoloch are considered immature specimens of Pachycephalosaurus [<a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007626\">36</a>]. And then there was the whole deal where Brontosaurus didn’t exist for a while and then it did again and it was all very confusing [<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/04/07/brontosaurus-is-back/#.V6179Ch97IU\">37</a>].</p>\n<p>Obviously, at the end of the day, a zebra is materially different from a dog in the same way that, to get back to the original topic, a penis is materially different from a vagina (actually a bad analogy since homologous reproductive organs are much more similar to each other than taxa that have been separated for millions of years, but anyway). The biological differences and similarities <i>themselves</i> exist, but any attempt to categorise and quantify them will necessarily rely on socially constructed and frequently arbitrary models, definitions and assumptions. That’s basically what science is - a continuous (and frequently wildly inaccurate) attempt to try to make sense of reality. We often attempt to understand or make predictions about reality using mathematical or quantitative models of the situation or by sorting things into sets and categories, which is useful and necessary in many cases but is also often far too simplistic to be taken as any kind of gospel truth regarding the actual nature of reality, because simply put reality doesn’t care for or abide by human-made rules and categories. Essentially, we’re trying to find quantitative ways to represent things that are by nature qualitative, and that’s always going to be arbitrary to some extent. Obviously biological characteristics (whether genetic, sexual/reproductive, etc.) objectively exist and would continue to exist if humans and human culture were to suddenly disappear, and in that sense, things like sex, gender and taxonomic classification can be said to be <i>based</i> <i>in</i> biological reality. But <i>human attempts to define or categorise </i>these characteristics - for example species concepts, the binary model of sex, etc. - are not in themselves biological realities, and are subject to change based on new information. For example, evolutionarily speaking, “reptiles” (as we traditionally understand them) don’t exist [<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028132-500-rewriting-the-textbooks-no-such-thing-as-reptiles/\">38</a>]. <i>Obviously</i> this doesn’t mean that lizards, tortoises, snakes, crocodiles, non-avian dinosaurs etc. don’t exist or never existed. It simply means that the <i>socially constructed classification</i> of animals into two distinct, mutually exclusive groups called “reptiles” and “birds” is completely arbitrary and not actually the result of any inherent biological reality (in fact the opposite).</p>\n<p>I mean I know how crappy the highschool biology syllabus can be <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGCSMW5JgN0evzQ04yqvNlQ\">@valarie-lynn</a> so I’ll also link you to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species\">Wikipedia page on species</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_problem\">species problem</a>, and also to <a href=\"http://aparticularlygoodfinder.tumblr.com/post/120136580933/sometimestheresgodsoquickly\">some</a> <a href=\"http://elodieunderglass.tumblr.com/post/147781801855/squeeterbee-downwithcisfandom-vergess\">more</a> <a href=\"http://koryos.tumblr.com/post/120647170121/in-light-of-my-recent-posts-on-the-genitalia-of\">on</a> <a href=\"http://koryos.tumblr.com/post/120785113726/what-do-you-mean-by-intersex-animals\">sex</a> and how it’s just as complicated and arbitrary as the concept of species (from Actual Biologists™) if you’re interested. I’ll also leave you with a quote from Charles Darwin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from the word variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms.

I really don’t think you want to open this can of worms.</p>\n<p>I mean, I know that in school they teach you a very clean, concise, definitive way of doing things and you’ve probably learnt something like <i>the definition of a species is a population of organisms that are able to reproduce and produce viable offspring</i>, or something. But I mean literally anyone who has done even undergrad biology can tell you that that statement is <i>incredibly</i> reductive and incredibly controversial in the scientific community [<a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf\">1</a>][<a href=\"http://evolution.powernet.ru/library/Scienc6.pdf\">2</a>]. In fact, you probably don’t even need a background in biology to spot the obvious flaw in the logic there, which is the fact that organisms classified as different species <i>do</i> reproduce and produce viable offspring. Quite a lot, actually. Lions and tigers (<i>Panthera leo</i> and <i>P. tigris</i>), coyotes and grey wolves (<i>Canis latrans</i> and <i>C. lupus</i>)… In fact, there’s even a word for new species arising through hybridisation between existing species - hybrid speciation [<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7133/full/nature05706.html\">3</a>]. The great skua (<i>Stercorarius skua</i>) is believed to be an example of this in animals [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1688246/pdf/9061968.pdf\">4</a>], and another interesting one that may be pretty much hybrid speciation in action (though not nearly anything that can be called a new distinct species yet) is the so-called “Eastern coyote”, a population of wild coyotes in the eastern US that are mixed with grey wolf and domestic dog, and can contain as much as 40% non-coyote DNA [<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/yes-eastern-coyotes-are-hybrids-but-the-coywolf-is-not-a-thing-50368\">5</a>]. </p>\n<p>And, in fact, the ability of two organisms to reproduce and produce viable offspring actually has very little with how we choose to classify them, because evolutionary and genetic relationships are rarely that simple. For example, some species that are the same genus - e.g. horses (<i>Equus ferus</i>) and donkeys (<i>Equus africanus</i>) can interbreed, but their offspring are usually sterile [<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061129150811.htm\">6</a>], while other species that are <i>different genera</i> to each other can interbreed to produce intergeneric hybrids, some of which are even fertile (for example crosses between false killer whales (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>) and bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7508288/#.V61oHCh97IU\">7</a>], or between king snakes (genus <i>Lampropeltis</i>) and corn snakes (genus <i>Pantherophis</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Snake-Hybridization-A-Case-for-Intrabaraminic-Diversity.pdf\">8</a>]). Most “exotic” domestic cat breeds (e.g. Bengals and Savannahs) also fall into this category - for some reason felids are genetically Weird in that a wide variety of species in the family Felidae seem able to interbreed with each other, no matter how different or distantly related they are.

Those species aren’t even in the same <i>subfamily</i>, let alone genus or genetic lineage - the leopard is classed as subfamily Pantherinae, genus <i>Panthera </i>(<i>P. pardus</i>) while the puma is classed as subfamily Felinae, genus <i>Puma </i>(<i>P. concolor</i>). </p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"2360\" data-orig-height=\"2355\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/6dd98a0cb8cc8ff174af16511371bbb4/tumblr_inline_obs9ruY31B1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2360\" data-orig-height=\"2355\"></figure><p>[<a href=\"http://messybeast.com/small-hybrids/hybrids.htm\">9</a>]</p>\n<p>Although these aren’t even the most distantly related species that are able to interbreed - domestic chickens (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) are known to hybridise with guineafowl [<a href=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/nvj/article/viewFile/3595/38131\">10</a>], and the offspring of these crosses are interfamilial hybrids since chickens and guineafowl are classified in different families (chickens belong to family Phasianidae, guineafowl to family Numididae).</p>\n<p>And of course another place where the “able to interbreed and produce viable offspring” definition falls apart is with organisms that reproduce asexually or without the need for a sexual partner, which is even more complicated when you consider that some species (for example, some species in the paraphyletic whiptail lizard genus <i>Cnemidophorus</i>) are<i> </i>dioecious, meaning they have separate sexes, and reproduce by producing gametes via meiosis, but have actually lost the ability to reproduce sexually somewhere along the evolutionary line - these species reproduce predominantly or entirely by parthenogenesis (essentially a form of self-cloning) and the Y chromosome has been entirely lost in the population. This also ties into hybrid speciation because it is believed that these parthenogenic species arose from hybridisation between two or three sexual species [<a href=\"http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/3369\">11</a>][<a href=\"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3099/MCZ17.1\">12</a>], leading to polyploid individuals (i.e. those with ‘extra’ sets of chromosomes) - for example, the all-female parthenogenic species <i>Cnemidophorus neomexicanus</i> is actually a hybrid of two sexual species, <i>Cnemidophorus inornatus</i> and<i> C. marmoratus </i>(or <i>C. tigris</i>, according to Wikipedia), and thus new individuals of this species can be formed either by parthenogenesis in a single <i>C. neomexicanus</i> parent, or sexual reproduction between a male and female <i>C. inornatus</i> and <i>C. marmoratus</i>/<i>C. tigris </i>[<a href=\"http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/handle/2246/5187//v2/dspace/ingest/pdfSource/nov/N2905.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">13</a>]. Some female parthenogenic species are also able to interbreed sexually with males from sexual species, resulting in hybrids which may or may not also be parthenogenic [<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1442858.pdf\">14</a>].</p>\n<p>So you can ask, well what the fuck is a genus, or a species for that matter, if it doesn’t necessarily indicate whether two animals are genetically similar enough to interbreed or not? And, more to the point, is there a strict set of quantitative criteria that defines whether two populations of organisms are classified as the same or different species? And I mentioned speciation, which brings up the question, when exactly in the process of evolution does one species actually become another?</p>\n<p>The thing is, there aren’t actually definitive answers to these questions - if you ask a bunch of biologists what a species is, it’s likely you’ll get different answers. “Species” also has a number of definitions [<a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/10/01/a-list-of-26-species-concepts/\">15</a>][<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl_1/6600.full\">16</a>], mainly depending on the type of organism being studied and the angle it is being studied from. For bacteria, for instance - where “similar enough to reproduce” really isn’t applicable - I think the general consensus is that individuals are grouped together if their genetic similarity to one another is 97-98% or higher, while a similar definition of “organisms that are highly genetically similar to one another” tends to be used for asexually reproducing organisms such as some plants, and parthenogenic animals like whiptail lizards or Bdelloid rotifers (which does of course raise the question of what exactly “highly similar” means - any decided-upon cutoff point will necessarily be somewhat arbitrary). Such groupings of organisms may be referred to as <i>phylotypes</i> to distinguish them from the reproductive definition of a “species” [<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-11274-4_1210\">17</a>]. Likewise, a lot of ecological writing will define species and speciation according to <i>reproductive isolation</i>, which isn’t necessarily synonymous with reproductive compatibility - reproductively isolated populations may be genetically able to reproduce, but be prevented from doing so or unlikely to do naturally so due to differences in geographical location, habitat or behaviour (think lions and tigers). These are some of the many different “types” of species, with either competing or overlapping definitions of what exactly constitutes a species in each case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Morphological or typological species (morphospecies)<br>\n</li>\n<li>Phylogenetic species<br>\n</li>\n<li>Evolutionary species<br>\n</li>\n<li>Genetic species<br>\n</li>\n<li>Genalogical concordance species</li>\n<li>Reproductive species<br>\n</li>\n<li>Autapomorphic species</li>\n<li>Ecological species<br>\n</li>\n<li>Recognition species<br>\n</li>\n<li>Phenetic species<br>\n</li>\n<li>Isolation species</li>\n<li>Cohesion species</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…You get the idea.</p>\n<p>For vertebrates, I <i>think</i> generally the two most used definitions are the biological species concept (BSC) and phylogenetic or cladistic species concept (PSC), which differ in their criteria for what they consider a species [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871894/\">18</a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2620362/\">19</a>]. PSC, for example, doesn’t include a subspecies category while BSC does - and thus, some organisms that are classified as subspecies of the same species under BSC are either classified as different species or are lumped together as the same species under PSC. For example, grey wolves and domestic dogs. The domestic dog is/was often considered a separate species to the grey wolf, for obvious (morphological/behavioural) reasons - the wolf was <i>Canis lupus</i>, the dog <i>C. familiaris</i> - but since dogs are descended from wolves (a now-extinct lineage of wolves, not modern grey wolves [<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(15)00432-7\">20</a>], but <i>Canis lupus</i> nonetheless) they are more properly classified as a subspecies, <i>C. l. familiaris</i>. Likewise, having also ultimately descended from wolves, the dingo is officially classified as <i>C. l. dingo</i>, although there is some debate about that - at one stage I remember it being classified as a “subspecies” of domestic dog, <i>Canis lupus familiaris dingo </i>(and it’s still, to my knowledge, widely considered to be descended from domestic dogs [<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2009/10/10/what-a-dingo-is/\">21</a>][<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC514485/\">22</a>], in which case the second name would be more correct), while still other people classify it as a completely separate species, <i>Canis dingo </i>[<a href=\"http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2014/04/dingo-declared-a-separate-species\">23</a>]. You can see why species boundaries and definitions can get murky, especially when the exact evolutionary origins of a particular animal are unknown or hotly contested.</p>\n<p>In fact, canids as a whole are kind of a mess when it comes to phylogeny. How many species of wolf there are really depends on who you ask - some populations traditionally classified as subspecies of the grey wolf, for example the Indian wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. pallipes</i>), the Himalayan or Tibetan wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. chanco</i>) and the Eastern wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. lycaon</i>) have been suggested instead to be classified as separate species - <i>Canis indica</i>, <i>Canis himalayensis</i> and <i>Canis lycaon</i>, respectively [<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0469.2006.00400.x/abstract\">24</a>][<a href=\"http://redwolves.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/14-Kyle-et-al.-2006.pdf\">25</a>]. Likewise, just last year it was discovered that what was thought to be an African subspecies of the golden jackal (<i>Canis aureus</i>) had in fact been misidentified and was instead an undiscovered species of wolf, now the African golden wolf (<i>Canis anthus</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15899/20150808/meet-african-golden-wolf-new-canine-disovered-150-years.htm\">26</a>]. And then there’s also the fact that, despite being called “jackals”, the black-backed and side-striped jackals actually aren’t very closely related to the golden jackal, or indeed to any of the rest of the genus <i>Canis </i>[<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2012/08/23/jackal-is-a-meaningless-term/\">27</a>]. In fact, going by the cladogram below, you can see that the African wild dog and dhole - both of which are classed in their own, unique genera (<i>Lycaon</i> and <i>Cuon</i>, respectively) - are actually placed closer to wolves, golden jackals and coyotes than black-backed and side-striped jackals are, even though both of the latter species are considered part of genus <i>Canis </i>(the black-backed jackal is <i>C. mesomelas </i>and the side-striped is <i>C. adustus</i>). Many sources also say that these two species differ from the rest of the group in that they have only 74 chromosomes, while wolves, coyotes, golden jackals, African wild dogs and dholes all have 78. This makes the moniker of genus <i>Canis</i> somewhat useless when trying to determine exactly how genetically similar these animals actually are to one another.</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"769\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42e653087c3a0398d7b1e64ad8677e8d/tumblr_inline_obpmdqc3hg1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"769\"></figure><p>[<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2012/02/04/canis-is-a-paraphyletic-genus/\">28</a>]</p>\n<p>And this isn’t even touching the issue of the “red wolf” (<i>Canis rufus</i>), a critically endangered so-called “species” of wolf closely related to the grey wolf, eastern wolf and coyote, which more recent molecular and genetic analysis has revealed may simply be a wolf/coyote hybrid [<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149496/\">29</a>]. Of course these classifications aren’t set in stone, either - new studies and discoveries are constantly uprooting and rewriting our knowledge of phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships among species. Sometimes it’s also pretty much impossible to accurately represent the relationships between similar-but-distinct populations using only the terms “genus” and “species”, which is where alternate concepts like <i>species complex</i>, <i>subgenus</i> and <i>superspecies</i> come in.<br></p>\n<p>Another feature of evolution and speciation that makes classification difficult is what are known as <i>ring species</i>, in which a series of neighbouring populations of organisms may evolve divergently (i.e. undergo allopatric speciation) in such a way that each geographically adjacent or overlapping population can interbreed with the next, but the last population in the “ring” has diverged to the point that it can no longer interbreed with the first (basically, population A can interbreed with population B, B with C and C with D, but D can no longer interbreed with A). </p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"381\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6bcdff677111dc807428b85bb5768a4b/tumblr_inline_obpn0gvrtx1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"381\"></figure><p>[<a href=\"http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/Evolution_GIST_2013/files_2013/articles/Irwin%20et%20al.%20-%202005%20-%20Speciation%20by%20distance%20in%20a%20ring%20species.pdf\">30</a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612659/\">31</a>]</p>\n<p>When does the actual split occur, and at what point in the ring can we consider the populations to be different species? We just don’t know. (And in some cases this is considerably more messy and complicated than even the ring species model makes it seem [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691675/\">32</a>]). The point is, though, that there is no definitive, universally agreed-upon cutoff point at which we can say with certainty that two organisms have evolved sufficiently as to become different species, any more than you can definitively say where along a rainbow spectrum of colours red becomes orange or orange becomes yellow. The decision whether to lump or split taxa becomes even more arbitrary in paleontology than it is with extant species [<a href=\"http://waxing-paleontological.blogspot.co.za/2014/10/taxonomic-messes.html\">33</a>][<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1301061.pdf?_=1470986977789\">34</a>] - when you’re working with an incomplete fossil record and pretty much going entirely on morphological similarities since genetic or molecular analysis often isn’t possible, there isn’t really a way to conclusively determine whether that specimen you found represents a new species, a new genus, or is simply a larger/smaller/juvenile/unfortunate-looking version of an already-described animal. Many specimens now believed to be juveniles of previously-described species were originally believed to be completely new ones - for example, Nanotyrannus is now often (but not universally) agreed to be a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex [<a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/witmerl/Downloads/2010_Witmer_&amp;_Ridgely_Cleveland_tyrannosaur.pdf\">35</a>], and Dracorex and Stygimoloch are considered immature specimens of Pachycephalosaurus [<a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007626\">36</a>]. And then there was the whole deal where Brontosaurus didn’t exist for a while and then it did again and it was all very confusing [<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/04/07/brontosaurus-is-back/#.V6179Ch97IU\">37</a>].</p>\n<p>Obviously, at the end of the day, a zebra is materially different from a dog in the same way that, to get back to the original topic, a penis is materially different from a vagina (actually a bad analogy since homologous reproductive organs are much more similar to each other than taxa that have been separated for millions of years, but anyway). The biological differences and similarities <i>themselves</i> exist, but any attempt to categorise and quantify them will necessarily rely on socially constructed and frequently arbitrary models, definitions and assumptions. That’s basically what science is - a continuous (and frequently wildly inaccurate) attempt to try to make sense of reality. We often attempt to understand or make predictions about reality using mathematical or quantitative models of the situation or by sorting things into sets and categories, which is useful and necessary in many cases but is also often far too simplistic to be taken as any kind of gospel truth regarding the actual nature of reality, because simply put reality doesn’t care for or abide by human-made rules and categories. Essentially, we’re trying to find quantitative ways to represent things that are by nature qualitative, and that’s always going to be arbitrary to some extent. Obviously biological characteristics (whether genetic, sexual/reproductive, etc.) objectively exist and would continue to exist if humans and human culture were to suddenly disappear, and in that sense, things like sex, gender and taxonomic classification can be said to be <i>based</i> <i>in</i> biological reality. But <i>human attempts to define or categorise </i>these characteristics - for example species concepts, the binary model of sex, etc. - are not in themselves biological realities, and are subject to change based on new information. For example, evolutionarily speaking, “reptiles” (as we traditionally understand them) don’t exist [<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028132-500-rewriting-the-textbooks-no-such-thing-as-reptiles/\">38</a>]. <i>Obviously</i> this doesn’t mean that lizards, tortoises, snakes, crocodiles, non-avian dinosaurs etc. don’t exist or never existed. It simply means that the <i>socially constructed classification</i> of animals into two distinct, mutually exclusive groups called “reptiles” and “birds” is completely arbitrary and not actually the result of any inherent biological reality (in fact the opposite).</p>\n<p>I mean I know how crappy the highschool biology syllabus can be <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGCSMW5JgN0evzQ04yqvNlQ\">@valarie-lynn</a> so I’ll also link you to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species\">Wikipedia page on species</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_problem\">species problem</a>, and also to <a href=\"http://aparticularlygoodfinder.tumblr.com/post/120136580933/sometimestheresgodsoquickly\">some</a> <a href=\"http://elodieunderglass.tumblr.com/post/147781801855/squeeterbee-downwithcisfandom-vergess\">more</a> <a href=\"http://koryos.tumblr.com/post/120647170121/in-light-of-my-recent-posts-on-the-genitalia-of\">on</a> <a href=\"http://koryos.tumblr.com/post/120785113726/what-do-you-mean-by-intersex-animals\">sex</a> and how it’s just as complicated and arbitrary as the concept of species (from Actual Biologists™) if you’re interested. I’ll also leave you with a quote from Charles Darwin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from the word variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms.

Buddy. <i>Dude</i>. I really don’t think you want to open this can of worms.</p>\n<p>I mean, I know that in school they teach you a very clean, concise, definitive way of doing things and you’ve probably learnt something like <i>the definition of a species is a population of organisms that are able to reproduce and produce viable offspring</i>, or something. But I mean literally anyone who has done even undergrad biology can tell you that that statement is <i>incredibly</i> reductive and incredibly controversial in the scientific community [<a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf\">1</a>][<a href=\"http://evolution.powernet.ru/library/Scienc6.pdf\">2</a>]. In fact, you probably don’t even need a background in biology to spot the obvious flaw in the logic there, which is the fact that organisms classified as different species <i>do</i> reproduce and produce viable offspring. Quite a lot, actually. Lions and tigers (<i>Panthera leo</i> and <i>P. tigris</i>), coyotes and grey wolves (<i>Canis latrans</i> and <i>C. lupus</i>)… In fact, there’s even a word for new species arising through hybridisation between existing species - hybrid speciation [<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7133/full/nature05706.html\">3</a>]. The great skua (<i>Stercorarius skua</i>) is believed to be an example of this in animals [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1688246/pdf/9061968.pdf\">4</a>], and another interesting one that may be pretty much hybrid speciation in action (though not nearly anything that can be called a new distinct species yet) is the so-called “Eastern coyote”, a population of wild coyotes in the eastern US that are mixed with grey wolf and domestic dog, and can contain as much as 40% non-coyote DNA [<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/yes-eastern-coyotes-are-hybrids-but-the-coywolf-is-not-a-thing-50368\">5</a>]. </p>\n<p>And, in fact, the ability of two organisms to reproduce and produce viable offspring actually has very little with how we choose to classify them, because evolutionary and genetic relationships are rarely that simple. For example, some species that are the same genus - e.g. horses (<i>Equus ferus</i>) and donkeys (<i>Equus africanus</i>) can interbreed, but their offspring are usually sterile [<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061129150811.htm\">6</a>], while other species that are <i>different genera</i> to each other can interbreed to produce intergeneric hybrids, some of which are even fertile (for example crosses between false killer whales (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>) and bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7508288/#.V61oHCh97IU\">7</a>], or between king snakes (genus <i>Lampropeltis</i>) and corn snakes (genus <i>Pantherophis</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Snake-Hybridization-A-Case-for-Intrabaraminic-Diversity.pdf\">8</a>]). Most “exotic” domestic cat breeds (e.g. Bengals and Savannahs) also fall into this category - for some reason felids are genetically Weird in that a wide variety of species in the family Felidae seem able to interbreed with each other, no matter how different or distantly related they are. I mean…</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"652\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/de9535995ecf113b98b77bca695462ef/tumblr_inline_obpkn2oSZQ1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"652\"></figure><p><br></p>\n<p>Look at this shit. Now bear in mind that the domestic cat (<i>Felis catus</i>) is known to be able to interbreed with species in the caracal, ocelot, lynx and leopard cat lineages in addition to those in its own lineage, and if that wasn’t bad enough <i>puma/leopard hybrids</i> are a thing that exist. Those species aren’t even in the same <i>subfamily</i>, let alone genus or genetic lineage - the leopard is classed as subfamily Pantherinae, genus <i>Panthera </i>(<i>P. pardus</i>) while the puma is classed as subfamily Felinae, genus <i>Puma </i>(<i>P. concolor</i>). </p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"2360\" data-orig-height=\"2355\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/6dd98a0cb8cc8ff174af16511371bbb4/tumblr_inline_obs9ruY31B1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2360\" data-orig-height=\"2355\"></figure><p>[<a href=\"http://messybeast.com/small-hybrids/hybrids.htm\">9</a>]</p>\n<p>Although these aren’t even the most distantly related species that are able to interbreed - domestic chickens (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) are known to hybridise with guineafowl [<a href=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/nvj/article/viewFile/3595/38131\">10</a>], and the offspring of these crosses are interfamilial hybrids since chickens and guineafowl are classified in different families (chickens belong to family Phasianidae, guineafowl to family Numididae).</p>\n<p>And of course another place where the “able to interbreed and produce viable offspring” definition falls apart is with organisms that reproduce asexually or without the need for a sexual partner, which is even more complicated when you consider that some species (for example, some species in the paraphyletic whiptail lizard genus <i>Cnemidophorus</i>) are<i> </i>dioecious, meaning they have separate sexes, and reproduce by producing gametes via meiosis, but have actually lost the ability to reproduce sexually somewhere along the evolutionary line - these species reproduce predominantly or entirely by parthenogenesis (essentially a form of self-cloning) and the Y chromosome has been entirely lost in the population. This also ties into hybrid speciation because it is believed that these parthenogenic species arose from hybridisation between two or three sexual species [<a href=\"http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/3369\">11</a>][<a href=\"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3099/MCZ17.1\">12</a>], leading to polyploid individuals (i.e. those with ‘extra’ sets of chromosomes) - for example, the all-female parthenogenic species <i>Cnemidophorus neomexicanus</i> is actually a hybrid of two sexual species, <i>Cnemidophorus inornatus</i> and<i> C. marmoratus </i>(or <i>C. tigris</i>, according to Wikipedia), and thus new individuals of this species can be formed either by parthenogenesis in a single <i>C. neomexicanus</i> parent, or sexual reproduction between a male and female <i>C. inornatus</i> and <i>C. marmoratus</i>/<i>C. tigris </i>[<a href=\"http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/handle/2246/5187//v2/dspace/ingest/pdfSource/nov/N2905.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">13</a>]. Some female parthenogenic species are also able to interbreed sexually with males from sexual species, resulting in hybrids which may or may not also be parthenogenic [<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1442858.pdf\">14</a>].</p>\n<p>So you can ask, well what the fuck is a genus, or a species for that matter, if it doesn’t necessarily indicate whether two animals are genetically similar enough to interbreed or not? And, more to the point, is there a strict set of quantitative criteria that defines whether two populations of organisms are classified as the same or different species? And I mentioned speciation, which brings up the question, when exactly in the process of evolution does one species actually become another?</p>\n<p>The thing is, there aren’t actually definitive answers to these questions - if you ask a bunch of biologists what a species is, it’s likely you’ll get different answers. “Species” also has a number of definitions [<a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/10/01/a-list-of-26-species-concepts/\">15</a>][<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl_1/6600.full\">16</a>], mainly depending on the type of organism being studied and the angle it is being studied from. For bacteria, for instance - where “similar enough to reproduce” really isn’t applicable - I think the general consensus is that individuals are grouped together if their genetic similarity to one another is 97-98% or higher, while a similar definition of “organisms that are highly genetically similar to one another” tends to be used for asexually reproducing organisms such as some plants, and parthenogenic animals like whiptail lizards or Bdelloid rotifers (which does of course raise the question of what exactly “highly similar” means - any decided-upon cutoff point will necessarily be somewhat arbitrary). Such groupings of organisms may be referred to as <i>phylotypes</i> to distinguish them from the reproductive definition of a “species” [<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-11274-4_1210\">17</a>]. Likewise, a lot of ecological writing will define species and speciation according to <i>reproductive isolation</i>, which isn’t necessarily synonymous with reproductive compatibility - reproductively isolated populations may be genetically able to reproduce, but be prevented from doing so or unlikely to do naturally so due to differences in geographical location, habitat or behaviour (think lions and tigers). These are some of the many different “types” of species, with either competing or overlapping definitions of what exactly constitutes a species in each case:</p>\n<ul><li>Morphological or typological species (morphospecies)<br></li>\n<li>Phylogenetic species<br></li>\n<li>Evolutionary species<br></li>\n<li>Genetic species<br></li>\n<li>Genalogical concordance species</li>\n<li>Reproductive species<br></li>\n<li>Autapomorphic species</li>\n<li>Ecological species<br></li>\n<li>Recognition species<br></li>\n<li>Phenetic species<br></li>\n<li>Isolation species</li>\n<li>Cohesion species</li>\n</ul><p>…You get the idea.</p>\n<p>For vertebrates, I <i>think</i> generally the two most used definitions are the biological species concept (BSC) and phylogenetic or cladistic species concept (PSC), which differ in their criteria for what they consider a species [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871894/\">18</a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2620362/\">19</a>]. PSC, for example, doesn’t include a subspecies category while BSC does - and thus, some organisms that are classified as subspecies of the same species under BSC are either classified as different species or are lumped together as the same species under PSC. For example, grey wolves and domestic dogs. The domestic dog is/was often considered a separate species to the grey wolf, for obvious (morphological/behavioural) reasons - the wolf was <i>Canis lupus</i>, the dog <i>C. familiaris</i> - but since dogs are descended from wolves (a now-extinct lineage of wolves, not modern grey wolves [<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(15)00432-7\">20</a>], but <i>Canis lupus</i> nonetheless) they are more properly classified as a subspecies, <i>C. l. familiaris</i>. Likewise, having also ultimately descended from wolves, the dingo is officially classified as <i>C. l. dingo</i>, although there is some debate about that - at one stage I remember it being classified as a “subspecies” of domestic dog, <i>Canis lupus familiaris dingo </i>(and it’s still, to my knowledge, widely considered to be descended from domestic dogs [<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2009/10/10/what-a-dingo-is/\">21</a>][<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC514485/\">22</a>], in which case the second name would be more correct), while still other people classify it as a completely separate species, <i>Canis dingo </i>[<a href=\"http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2014/04/dingo-declared-a-separate-species\">23</a>]. You can see why species boundaries and definitions can get murky, especially when the exact evolutionary origins of a particular animal are unknown or hotly contested.</p>\n<p>In fact, canids as a whole are kind of a mess when it comes to phylogeny. How many species of wolf there are really depends on who you ask - some populations traditionally classified as subspecies of the grey wolf, for example the Indian wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. pallipes</i>), the Himalayan or Tibetan wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. chanco</i>) and the Eastern wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. lycaon</i>) have been suggested instead to be classified as separate species - <i>Canis indica</i>, <i>Canis himalayensis</i> and <i>Canis lycaon</i>, respectively [<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0469.2006.00400.x/abstract\">24</a>][<a href=\"http://redwolves.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/14-Kyle-et-al.-2006.pdf\">25</a>]. Likewise, just last year it was discovered that what was thought to be an African subspecies of the golden jackal (<i>Canis aureus</i>) had in fact been misidentified and was instead an undiscovered species of wolf, now the African golden wolf (<i>Canis anthus</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15899/20150808/meet-african-golden-wolf-new-canine-disovered-150-years.htm\">26</a>]. And then there’s also the fact that, despite being called “jackals”, the black-backed and side-striped jackals actually aren’t very closely related to the golden jackal, or indeed to any of the rest of the genus <i>Canis </i>[<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2012/08/23/jackal-is-a-meaningless-term/\">27</a>]. In fact, going by the cladogram below, you can see that the African wild dog and dhole - both of which are classed in their own, unique genera (<i>Lycaon</i> and <i>Cuon</i>, respectively) - are actually placed closer to wolves, golden jackals and coyotes than black-backed and side-striped jackals are, even though both of the latter species are considered part of genus <i>Canis </i>(the black-backed jackal is <i>C. mesomelas </i>and the side-striped is <i>C. adustus</i>). Many sources also say that these two species differ from the rest of the group in that they have only 74 chromosomes, while wolves, coyotes, golden jackals, African wild dogs and dholes all have 78. This makes the moniker of genus <i>Canis</i> somewhat useless when trying to determine exactly how genetically similar these animals actually are to one another.</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"769\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42e653087c3a0398d7b1e64ad8677e8d/tumblr_inline_obpmdqc3hg1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"769\"></figure><p>[<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2012/02/04/canis-is-a-paraphyletic-genus/\">28</a>]</p>\n<p>And this isn’t even touching the issue of the “red wolf” (<i>Canis rufus</i>), a critically endangered so-called “species” of wolf closely related to the grey wolf, eastern wolf and coyote, which more recent molecular and genetic analysis has revealed may simply be a wolf/coyote hybrid [<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149496/\">29</a>]. Of course these classifications aren’t set in stone, either - new studies and discoveries are constantly uprooting and rewriting our knowledge of phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships among species. Sometimes it’s also pretty much impossible to accurately represent the relationships between similar-but-distinct populations using only the terms “genus” and “species”, which is where alternate concepts like <i>species complex</i>, <i>subgenus</i> and <i>superspecies</i> come in.<br></p>\n<p>Another feature of evolution and speciation that makes classification difficult is what are known as <i>ring species</i>, in which a series of neighbouring populations of organisms may evolve divergently (i.e. undergo allopatric speciation) in such a way that each geographically adjacent or overlapping population can interbreed with the next, but the last population in the “ring” has diverged to the point that it can no longer interbreed with the first (basically, population A can interbreed with population B, B with C and C with D, but D can no longer interbreed with A). </p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"381\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6bcdff677111dc807428b85bb5768a4b/tumblr_inline_obpn0gvrtx1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"381\"></figure><p>[<a href=\"http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/Evolution_GIST_2013/files_2013/articles/Irwin%20et%20al.%20-%202005%20-%20Speciation%20by%20distance%20in%20a%20ring%20species.pdf\">30</a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612659/\">31</a>]</p>\n<p>When does the actual split occur, and at what point in the ring can we consider the populations to be different species? We just don’t know. (And in some cases this is considerably more messy and complicated than even the ring species model makes it seem [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691675/\">32</a>]). The point is, though, that there is no definitive, universally agreed-upon cutoff point at which we can say with certainty that two organisms have evolved sufficiently as to become different species, any more than you can definitively say where along a rainbow spectrum of colours red becomes orange or orange becomes yellow. The decision whether to lump or split taxa becomes even more arbitrary in paleontology than it is with extant species [<a href=\"http://waxing-paleontological.blogspot.co.za/2014/10/taxonomic-messes.html\">33</a>][<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1301061.pdf?_=1470986977789\">34</a>] - when you’re working with an incomplete fossil record and pretty much going entirely on morphological similarities since genetic or molecular analysis often isn’t possible, there isn’t really a way to conclusively determine whether that specimen you found represents a new species, a new genus, or is simply a larger/smaller/juvenile/unfortunate-looking version of an already-described animal. Many specimens now believed to be juveniles of previously-described species were originally believed to be completely new ones - for example, Nanotyrannus is now often (but not universally) agreed to be a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex [<a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/witmerl/Downloads/2010_Witmer_&amp;_Ridgely_Cleveland_tyrannosaur.pdf\">35</a>], and Dracorex and Stygimoloch are considered immature specimens of Pachycephalosaurus [<a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007626\">36</a>]. And then there was the whole deal where Brontosaurus didn’t exist for a while and then it did again and it was all very confusing [<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/04/07/brontosaurus-is-back/#.V6179Ch97IU\">37</a>].</p>\n<p>Obviously, at the end of the day, a zebra is materially different from a dog in the same way that, to get back to the original topic, a penis is materially different from a vagina (actually a bad analogy since homologous reproductive organs are much more similar to each other than taxa that have been separated for millions of years, but anyway). The biological differences and similarities <i>themselves</i> exist, but any attempt to categorise and quantify them will necessarily rely on socially constructed and frequently arbitrary models, definitions and assumptions. That’s basically what science is - a continuous (and frequently wildly inaccurate) attempt to try to make sense of reality. We often attempt to understand or make predictions about reality using mathematical or quantitative models of the situation or by sorting things into sets and categories, which is useful and necessary in many cases but is also often far too simplistic to be taken as any kind of gospel truth regarding the actual nature of reality, because simply put reality doesn’t care for or abide by human-made rules and categories. Essentially, we’re trying to find quantitative ways to represent things that are by nature qualitative, and that’s always going to be arbitrary to some extent. Obviously biological characteristics (whether genetic, sexual/reproductive, etc.) objectively exist and would continue to exist if humans and human culture were to suddenly disappear, and in that sense, things like sex, gender and taxonomic classification can be said to be <i>based</i> <i>in</i> biological reality. But <i>human attempts to define or categorise </i>these characteristics - for example species concepts, the binary model of sex, etc. - are not in themselves biological realities, and are subject to change based on new information. For example, evolutionarily speaking, “reptiles” (as we traditionally understand them) don’t exist [<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028132-500-rewriting-the-textbooks-no-such-thing-as-reptiles/\">38</a>]. <i>Obviously</i> this doesn’t mean that lizards, tortoises, snakes, crocodiles, non-avian dinosaurs etc. don’t exist or never existed. It simply means that the <i>socially constructed classification</i> of animals into two distinct, mutually exclusive groups called “reptiles” and “birds” is completely arbitrary and not actually the result of any inherent biological reality (in fact the opposite).</p>\n<p>I mean I know how crappy the highschool biology syllabus can be <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGCSMW5JgN0evzQ04yqvNlQ\">@valarie-lynn</a> so I’ll also link you to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species\">Wikipedia page on species</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_problem\">species problem</a>, and also to <a href=\"http://aparticularlygoodfinder.tumblr.com/post/120136580933/sometimestheresgodsoquickly\">some</a> <a href=\"http://elodieunderglass.tumblr.com/post/147781801855/squeeterbee-downwithcisfandom-vergess\">more</a> <a href=\"http://koryos.tumblr.com/post/120647170121/in-light-of-my-recent-posts-on-the-genitalia-of\">on</a> <a href=\"http://koryos.tumblr.com/post/120785113726/what-do-you-mean-by-intersex-animals\">sex</a> and how it’s just as complicated and arbitrary as the concept of species (from Actual Biologists™) if you’re interested. I’ll also leave you with a quote from Charles Darwin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from the word variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms.

Buddy. <i>Dude</i>. I really don’t think you want to open this can of worms.</p>\n<p>I mean, I know that in school they teach you a very clean, concise, definitive way of doing things and you’ve probably learnt something like <i>the definition of a species is a population of organisms that are able to reproduce and produce viable offspring</i>, or something. But I mean literally anyone who has done even undergrad biology can tell you that that statement is <i>incredibly</i> reductive and incredibly controversial in the scientific community [<a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf\">1</a>][<a href=\"http://evolution.powernet.ru/library/Scienc6.pdf\">2</a>]. In fact, you probably don’t even need a background in biology to spot the obvious flaw in the logic there, which is the fact that organisms classified as different species <i>do</i> reproduce and produce viable offspring. Quite a lot, actually. Lions and tigers (<i>Panthera leo</i> and <i>P. tigris</i>), coyotes and grey wolves (<i>Canis latrans</i> and <i>C. lupus</i>)… In fact, there’s even a word for new species arising through hybridisation between existing species - hybrid speciation [<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7133/full/nature05706.html\">3</a>]. The great skua (<i>Stercorarius skua</i>) is believed to be an example of this in animals [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1688246/pdf/9061968.pdf\">4</a>], and another interesting one that may be pretty much hybrid speciation in action (though not nearly anything that can be called a new distinct species yet) is the so-called “Eastern coyote”, a population of wild coyotes in the eastern US that are mixed with grey wolf and domestic dog, and can contain as much as 40% non-coyote DNA [<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/yes-eastern-coyotes-are-hybrids-but-the-coywolf-is-not-a-thing-50368\">5</a>]. </p>\n<p>And, in fact, the ability of two organisms to reproduce and produce viable offspring actually has very little with how we choose to classify them, because evolutionary and genetic relationships are rarely that simple. For example, some species that are the same genus - e.g. horses (<i>Equus ferus</i>) and donkeys (<i>Equus africanus</i>) can interbreed, but their offspring are usually sterile [<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061129150811.htm\">6</a>], while other species that are <i>different genera</i> to each other can interbreed to produce intergeneric hybrids, some of which are even fertile (for example crosses between false killer whales (<i>Pseudorca crassidens</i>) and bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7508288/#.V61oHCh97IU\">7</a>], or between king snakes (genus <i>Lampropeltis</i>) and corn snakes (genus <i>Pantherophis</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Snake-Hybridization-A-Case-for-Intrabaraminic-Diversity.pdf\">8</a>]). Most “exotic” domestic cat breeds (e.g. Bengals and Savannahs) also fall into this category - for some reason felids are genetically Weird in that a wide variety of species in the family Felidae seem able to interbreed with each other, no matter how different or distantly related they are. I mean…</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/de9535995ecf113b98b77bca695462ef/tumblr_inline_obpkn2oSZQ1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br /></p>\n<p>Look at this shit. Now bear in mind that the domestic cat (<i>Felis catus</i>) is known to be able to interbreed with species in the caracal, ocelot, lynx and leopard cat lineages in addition to those in its own lineage, and if that wasn’t bad enough <i>puma/leopard hybrids</i> are a thing that exist. Those species aren’t even in the same <i>subfamily</i>, let alone genus or genetic lineage - the leopard is classed as subfamily Pantherinae, genus <i>Panthera </i>(<i>P. pardus</i>) while the puma is classed as subfamily Felinae, genus <i>Puma </i>(<i>P. concolor</i>). </p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/6dd98a0cb8cc8ff174af16511371bbb4/tumblr_inline_obs9ruY31B1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>[<a href=\"http://messybeast.com/small-hybrids/hybrids.htm\">9</a>]</p>\n<p>Although these aren’t even the most distantly related species that are able to interbreed - domestic chickens (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) are known to hybridise with guineafowl [<a href=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/nvj/article/viewFile/3595/38131\">10</a>], and the offspring of these crosses are interfamilial hybrids since chickens and guineafowl are classified in different families (chickens belong to family Phasianidae, guineafowl to family Numididae).</p>\n<p>And of course another place where the “able to interbreed and produce viable offspring” definition falls apart is with organisms that reproduce asexually or without the need for a sexual partner, which is even more complicated when you consider that some species (for example, some species in the paraphyletic whiptail lizard genus <i>Cnemidophorus</i>) are<i> </i>dioecious, meaning they have separate sexes, and reproduce by producing gametes via meiosis, but have actually lost the ability to reproduce sexually somewhere along the evolutionary line - these species reproduce predominantly or entirely by parthenogenesis (essentially a form of self-cloning) and the Y chromosome has been entirely lost in the population. This also ties into hybrid speciation because it is believed that these parthenogenic species arose from hybridisation between two or three sexual species [<a href=\"http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/3369\">11</a>][<a href=\"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3099/MCZ17.1\">12</a>], leading to polyploid individuals (i.e. those with ‘extra’ sets of chromosomes) - for example, the all-female parthenogenic species <i>Cnemidophorus neomexicanus</i> is actually a hybrid of two sexual species, <i>Cnemidophorus inornatus</i> and<i> C. marmoratus </i>(or <i>C. tigris</i>, according to Wikipedia), and thus new individuals of this species can be formed either by parthenogenesis in a single <i>C. neomexicanus</i> parent, or sexual reproduction between a male and female <i>C. inornatus</i> and <i>C. marmoratus</i>/<i>C. tigris </i>[<a href=\"http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/handle/2246/5187//v2/dspace/ingest/pdfSource/nov/N2905.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">13</a>]. Some female parthenogenic species are also able to interbreed sexually with males from sexual species, resulting in hybrids which may or may not also be parthenogenic [<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1442858.pdf\">14</a>].</p>\n<p>So you can ask, well what the fuck is a genus, or a species for that matter, if it doesn’t necessarily indicate whether two animals are genetically similar enough to interbreed or not? And, more to the point, is there a strict set of quantitative criteria that defines whether two populations of organisms are classified as the same or different species? And I mentioned speciation, which brings up the question, when exactly in the process of evolution does one species actually become another?</p>\n<p>The thing is, there aren’t actually definitive answers to these questions - if you ask a bunch of biologists what a species is, it’s likely you’ll get different answers. “Species” also has a number of definitions [<a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/10/01/a-list-of-26-species-concepts/\">15</a>][<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl_1/6600.full\">16</a>], mainly depending on the type of organism being studied and the angle it is being studied from. For bacteria, for instance - where “similar enough to reproduce” really isn’t applicable - I think the general consensus is that individuals are grouped together if their genetic similarity to one another is 97-98% or higher, while a similar definition of “organisms that are highly genetically similar to one another” tends to be used for asexually reproducing organisms such as some plants, and parthenogenic animals like whiptail lizards or Bdelloid rotifers (which does of course raise the question of what exactly “highly similar” means - any decided-upon cutoff point will necessarily be somewhat arbitrary). Such groupings of organisms may be referred to as <i>phylotypes</i> to distinguish them from the reproductive definition of a “species” [<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-11274-4_1210\">17</a>]. Likewise, a lot of ecological writing will define species and speciation according to <i>reproductive isolation</i>, which isn’t necessarily synonymous with reproductive compatibility - reproductively isolated populations may be genetically able to reproduce, but be prevented from doing so or unlikely to do naturally so due to differences in geographical location, habitat or behaviour (think lions and tigers). These are some of the many different “types” of species, with either competing or overlapping definitions of what exactly constitutes a species in each case:</p>\n<ul><li>Morphological or typological species (morphospecies)<br /></li>\n<li>Phylogenetic species<br /></li>\n<li>Evolutionary species<br /></li>\n<li>Genetic species<br /></li>\n<li>Genalogical concordance species</li>\n<li>Reproductive species<br /></li>\n<li>Autapomorphic species</li>\n<li>Ecological species<br /></li>\n<li>Recognition species<br /></li>\n<li>Phenetic species<br /></li>\n<li>Isolation species</li>\n<li>Cohesion species</li>\n</ul><p>…You get the idea.</p>\n<p>For vertebrates, I <i>think</i> generally the two most used definitions are the biological species concept (BSC) and phylogenetic or cladistic species concept (PSC), which differ in their criteria for what they consider a species [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871894/\">18</a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2620362/\">19</a>]. PSC, for example, doesn’t include a subspecies category while BSC does - and thus, some organisms that are classified as subspecies of the same species under BSC are either classified as different species or are lumped together as the same species under PSC. For example, grey wolves and domestic dogs. The domestic dog is/was often considered a separate species to the grey wolf, for obvious (morphological/behavioural) reasons - the wolf was <i>Canis lupus</i>, the dog <i>C. familiaris</i> - but since dogs are descended from wolves (a now-extinct lineage of wolves, not modern grey wolves [<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(15)00432-7\">20</a>], but <i>Canis lupus</i> nonetheless) they are more properly classified as a subspecies, <i>C. l. familiaris</i>. Likewise, having also ultimately descended from wolves, the dingo is officially classified as <i>C. l. dingo</i>, although there is some debate about that - at one stage I remember it being classified as a “subspecies” of domestic dog, <i>Canis lupus familiaris dingo </i>(and it’s still, to my knowledge, widely considered to be descended from domestic dogs [<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2009/10/10/what-a-dingo-is/\">21</a>][<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC514485/\">22</a>], in which case the second name would be more correct), while still other people classify it as a completely separate species, <i>Canis dingo </i>[<a href=\"http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2014/04/dingo-declared-a-separate-species\">23</a>]. You can see why species boundaries and definitions can get murky, especially when the exact evolutionary origins of a particular animal are unknown or hotly contested.</p>\n<p>In fact, canids as a whole are kind of a mess when it comes to phylogeny. How many species of wolf there are really depends on who you ask - some populations traditionally classified as subspecies of the grey wolf, for example the Indian wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. pallipes</i>), the Himalayan or Tibetan wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. chanco</i>) and the Eastern wolf (traditionally <i>C. l. lycaon</i>) have been suggested instead to be classified as separate species - <i>Canis indica</i>, <i>Canis himalayensis</i> and <i>Canis lycaon</i>, respectively [<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0469.2006.00400.x/abstract\">24</a>][<a href=\"http://redwolves.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/14-Kyle-et-al.-2006.pdf\">25</a>]. Likewise, just last year it was discovered that what was thought to be an African subspecies of the golden jackal (<i>Canis aureus</i>) had in fact been misidentified and was instead an undiscovered species of wolf, now the African golden wolf (<i>Canis anthus</i>) [<a href=\"http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15899/20150808/meet-african-golden-wolf-new-canine-disovered-150-years.htm\">26</a>]. And then there’s also the fact that, despite being called “jackals”, the black-backed and side-striped jackals actually aren’t very closely related to the golden jackal, or indeed to any of the rest of the genus <i>Canis </i>[<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2012/08/23/jackal-is-a-meaningless-term/\">27</a>]. In fact, going by the cladogram below, you can see that the African wild dog and dhole - both of which are classed in their own, unique genera (<i>Lycaon</i> and <i>Cuon</i>, respectively) - are actually placed closer to wolves, golden jackals and coyotes than black-backed and side-striped jackals are, even though both of the latter species are considered part of genus <i>Canis </i>(the black-backed jackal is <i>C. mesomelas </i>and the side-striped is <i>C. adustus</i>). Many sources also say that these two species differ from the rest of the group in that they have only 74 chromosomes, while wolves, coyotes, golden jackals, African wild dogs and dholes all have 78. This makes the moniker of genus <i>Canis</i> somewhat useless when trying to determine exactly how genetically similar these animals actually are to one another.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42e653087c3a0398d7b1e64ad8677e8d/tumblr_inline_obpmdqc3hg1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>[<a href=\"https://retrieverman.net/2012/02/04/canis-is-a-paraphyletic-genus/\">28</a>]</p>\n<p>And this isn’t even touching the issue of the “red wolf” (<i>Canis rufus</i>), a critically endangered so-called “species” of wolf closely related to the grey wolf, eastern wolf and coyote, which more recent molecular and genetic analysis has revealed may simply be a wolf/coyote hybrid [<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149496/\">29</a>]. Of course these classifications aren’t set in stone, either - new studies and discoveries are constantly uprooting and rewriting our knowledge of phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships among species. Sometimes it’s also pretty much impossible to accurately represent the relationships between similar-but-distinct populations using only the terms “genus” and “species”, which is where alternate concepts like <i>species complex</i>, <i>subgenus</i> and <i>superspecies</i> come in.<br /></p>\n<p>Another feature of evolution and speciation that makes classification difficult is what are known as <i>ring species</i>, in which a series of neighbouring populations of organisms may evolve divergently (i.e. undergo allopatric speciation) in such a way that each geographically adjacent or overlapping population can interbreed with the next, but the last population in the “ring” has diverged to the point that it can no longer interbreed with the first (basically, population A can interbreed with population B, B with C and C with D, but D can no longer interbreed with A). </p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6bcdff677111dc807428b85bb5768a4b/tumblr_inline_obpn0gvrtx1rtc1nt_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>[<a href=\"http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/Evolution_GIST_2013/files_2013/articles/Irwin%20et%20al.%20-%202005%20-%20Speciation%20by%20distance%20in%20a%20ring%20species.pdf\">30</a>][<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612659/\">31</a>]</p>\n<p>When does the actual split occur, and at what point in the ring can we consider the populations to be different species? We just don’t know. (And in some cases this is considerably more messy and complicated than even the ring species model makes it seem [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1691675/\">32</a>]). The point is, though, that there is no definitive, universally agreed-upon cutoff point at which we can say with certainty that two organisms have evolved sufficiently as to become different species, any more than you can definitively say where along a rainbow spectrum of colours red becomes orange or orange becomes yellow. The decision whether to lump or split taxa becomes even more arbitrary in paleontology than it is with extant species [<a href=\"http://waxing-paleontological.blogspot.co.za/2014/10/taxonomic-messes.html\">33</a>][<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1301061.pdf?_=1470986977789\">34</a>] - when you’re working with an incomplete fossil record and pretty much going entirely on morphological similarities since genetic or molecular analysis often isn’t possible, there isn’t really a way to conclusively determine whether that specimen you found represents a new species, a new genus, or is simply a larger/smaller/juvenile/unfortunate-looking version of an already-described animal. Many specimens now believed to be juveniles of previously-described species were originally believed to be completely new ones - for example, Nanotyrannus is now often (but not universally) agreed to be a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex [<a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/witmerl/Downloads/2010_Witmer_&amp;_Ridgely_Cleveland_tyrannosaur.pdf\">35</a>], and Dracorex and Stygimoloch are considered immature specimens of Pachycephalosaurus [<a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007626\">36</a>]. And then there was the whole deal where Brontosaurus didn’t exist for a while and then it did again and it was all very confusing [<a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/04/07/brontosaurus-is-back/#.V6179Ch97IU\">37</a>].</p>\n<p>Obviously, at the end of the day, a zebra is materially different from a dog in the same way that, to get back to the original topic, a penis is materially different from a vagina (actually a bad analogy since homologous reproductive organs are much more similar to each other than taxa that have been separated for millions of years, but anyway). The biological differences and similarities <i>themselves</i> exist, but any attempt to categorise and quantify them will necessarily rely on socially constructed and frequently arbitrary models, definitions and assumptions. That’s basically what science is - a continuous (and frequently wildly inaccurate) attempt to try to make sense of reality. We often attempt to understand or make predictions about reality using mathematical or quantitative models of the situation or by sorting things into sets and categories, which is useful and necessary in many cases but is also often far too simplistic to be taken as any kind of gospel truth regarding the actual nature of reality, because simply put reality doesn’t care for or abide by human-made rules and categories. Essentially, we’re trying to find quantitative ways to represent things that are by nature qualitative, and that’s always going to be arbitrary to some extent. Obviously biological characteristics (whether genetic, sexual/reproductive, etc.) objectively exist and would continue to exist if humans and human culture were to suddenly disappear, and in that sense, things like sex, gender and taxonomic classification can be said to be <i>based</i> <i>in</i> biological reality. But <i>human attempts to define or categorise </i>these characteristics - for example species concepts, the binary model of sex, etc. - are not in themselves biological realities, and are subject to change based on new information. For example, evolutionarily speaking, “reptiles” (as we traditionally understand them) don’t exist [<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028132-500-rewriting-the-textbooks-no-such-thing-as-reptiles/\">38</a>]. <i>Obviously</i> this doesn’t mean that lizards, tortoises, snakes, crocodiles, non-avian dinosaurs etc. don’t exist or never existed.

The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for convenience sake\n\n.” [<a href=\"http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/origin/chapter2.html\">39</a>]<br /></p></blockquote>\n<p>…But you know, what would us simple SJWs know about our own fields of study \n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  Thank god we have the Pro-Science, Pro-Logic crowd to save us from the liberal Tumblr “rabbit hole”.</p>"},{"blog":{"name":"your-biology-is-wrong","active":true,"theme":{"header_full_width":259,"header_full_height":194,"header_focus_width":259,"header_focus_height":145,"avatar_shape":"square","background_color":"#6bf0ba","body_font":"Helvetica Neue","header_bounds":"24,259,169,0","header_image":"https://secure.static.tumblr.com/296787eccfb70e7a8c3187416a5af51a/54owsej/itho4ds18/tumblr_static_2jk54pb7jv0go44w8okg8ow4s.jpg","header_image_focused":"https://secure.static.tumblr.com/296787eccfb70e7a8c3187416a5af51a/54owsej/hUqo4ds18/tumblr_static_tumblr_static_2jk54pb7jv0go44w8okg8ow4s_focused_v3.jpg","header_image_scaled":"https://secure.static.tumblr.com/296787eccfb70e7a8c3187416a5af51a/54owsej/itho4ds18/tumblr_static_2jk54pb7jv0go44w8okg8ow4s_2048_v2.jpg","header_stretch":true,"link_color":"#0ab8e0","show_avatar":true,"show_description":true,"show_header_image":true,"show_title":true,"title_color":"#444444","title_font":"Gibson","title_font_weight":"bold"},"share_likes":false,"share_following":false},"post":{"id":"148835297134"},"content_raw":"<p>Holy fucking shit</p>\n<p>Thank you, my friend, for doing what I was admittedly too lazy to do</p>","content":"<p>Holy fucking shit</p>\n<p>Thank you, my friend, for doing what I was admittedly too lazy to do</p>"},{"blog":{"name":"unnounblr","active":true,"theme":{"avatar_shape":"square","background_color":"#FAFAFA","body_font":"Helvetica Neue","header_bounds":0,"header_image":"https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/images/default_header/optica_pattern_01.png?_v=f67ca5ac5d1c4a0526964674cb5a0605","header_image_focused":"https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/images/default_header/optica_pattern_01.png?_v=f67ca5ac5d1c4a0526964674cb5a0605","header_image_scaled":"https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/images/default_header/optica_pattern_01.png?_v=f67ca5ac5d1c4a0526964674cb5a0605","header_stretch":true,"link_color":"#529ECC","show_avatar":true,"show_description":true,"show_header_image":true,"show_title":true,"title_color":"#444444","title_font":"Gibson","title_font_weight":"bold"},"share_likes":true,"share_following":true},"post":{"id":"148980588947"},"content_raw":"<p>Same.</p>","content":"<p>Same.</p>"},{"blog":{"name":"froborr","active":true,"theme":{"avatar_shape":"square","background_color":"#F6F6F6","body_font":"Helvetica Neue","header_bounds":0,"header_image":"https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/images/default_header/optica_pattern_11.png?_v=4275fa0865b78225d79970023dde05a1","header_image_focused":"https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/images/default_header/optica_pattern_11.png?_v=4275fa0865b78225d79970023dde05a1","header_image_scaled":"https://secure.assets.tumblr.com/images/default_header/optica_pattern_11.png?_v=4275fa0865b78225d79970023dde05a1","header_stretch":true,"link_color":"#529ECC","show_avatar":true,"show_description":true,"show_header_image":true,"show_title":true,"title_color":"#444444","title_font":"Gibson","title_font_weight":"bold"},"share_likes":false,"share_following":false},"post":{"id":"148981328346"},"content_raw":"<p>Of course valarie-lynn is right, there <i>is</i> no point arguing with someone who recognizes the complexity of reality when you’re stuck in simplistic binaries.

Feminist struggle can be articulated into a chain with the struggle for social emancipation of the lower classes, or it can (and it certainly does) function as an ideological tool of the upper-middle classes to assert their superiority over the “patriarchal and intolerant” lower classes; and class antagonism is as it were “doubly inscribed” here: it is the specific constellation of the class struggle itself which explains why the feminist struggle was appropriated by upper classes. (The same goes for racism: it is the dynamics of class struggle itself which explains why direct racism is strong among the lowest white workers.)</p>\n\n<p>The third thing to take note of is the fundamental difference between feminist/anti-racist/anti-sexist etc. struggle and class struggle: in the first case, the goal is to translate antagonism into difference (“peaceful” coexistence of sexes, religions, ethnic groups), while the goal of the class struggle is precisely the opposite, i.e., to “aggravate” class difference into class antagonism. So what the series race-gender-class obfuscates is the different logic of the political space in the case of class: while the anti-racist and anti-sexist struggle are guided by the striving for the full recognition of the other, the class struggle aims at overcoming and subduing, annihilating even, the other - even if not a direct physical annihilation, class struggle aims at the annihilation of the other’s socio-political role and function. In other words, while it is logical to say that anti-racism wants all races to be allowed to freely assert and deploy their cultural, political and economic strivings, it is obviously meaningless to say that the aim of the proletarian class struggle is to allow the bourgeoisie to fully assert its identity and strivings… In one case, we have a “horizontal” logic of the recognition of different identities, while, in the other case, we have the logic of the struggle with an antagonist.</p>\n\n<p>The paradox here is that it is the populist fundamentalism which retains this logic of antagonism, while the liberal Left follows the logic of recognition of differences, of “defusing” antagonisms into co-existing differences: in their very form, the conservative-populist grass-roots campaigns took over the old Leftist-radical stance of the popular mobilization and struggle against upper-class exploitation. This unexpected reversal is just one in a long series. In today’s US, the traditional roles of Democrats and Republicans are almost inverted: Republicans spend state money, thus generating record budget deficit, de facto build a strong federal state, and pursue a politics of global interventionism, while Democrats pursue a tough fiscal politics that, under Clinton, abolished budget deficit. Even in the touchy sphere of socio-economic politics, Democrats (the same as with Blair in the UK) as a rule accomplish the neoliberal agenda of abolishing the Welfare State, lowering taxes, privatizing, etc., while Bush proposed a radical measure of legalizing the status of the millions of illegal Mexican workers and made healthcare much more accessible to the retired. The extreme case is here that of the survivalist groups in the West of the US: although their ideological message is that of religious racism, their entire mode of organization (small illegal groups fighting FBI and other federal agencies) makes them an uncanny double of the Black Panthers from the 1960s.</p>\n\n<p>We should thus not only refuse the easy liberal contempt for the populist fundamentalists (or, even worse, the patronizing regret of how “manipulated” they are); we should reject the very terms of the culture war. Although, of course, as to the positive content of most of the debated issues, a radical Leftist should support the liberal stance (for abortion, against racism and homophobia…), one should never forget that it is the populist fundamentalist, not the liberal, who is, in the long term, our ally. In all their anger, the populists are not angry enough - not radical enough to perceive the link between capitalism and the moral decay they deplore</p>","source":"(via <a

For hundreds of years, they were our only environmentalists; the only people who thought that land and rivers should be preserved in their natural state; the only people who thought a mountain, or a prairie, or a river could be a sacred place. Yesterday, a federal judge heard arguments from the tribes against the federal government’s approval of the pipeline, and said he will deliver his decision on whether the pipeline can proceed next month. There are now over 90 tribes gathered in protest of that pipeline. That protest will surely continue even if the judge allows construction to proceed. <b>And so, we face the prospect next month of the descendants of the first people to ever set foot on that land being arrested by the descendants of the invaders, who seized that land.

if identity is only a game, if it is only a procedure to have relations, social and sexual-pleasure relationships that create new friendships, it is useful. But if identity becomes the problem of sexual existence, and if people think that they have to ‘uncover’ their ‘own identity,’ and that their own identity has to become the law, the principle, the code of their existence; if the perennial question they ask is ‘Does this thing conform to my identity?’ then, I think, they will turn back to a kind of ethics very close to the old heterosexual virility. If we are asked to relate to the question of identity, it must be an identity to our unique selves. But the relationships we have to have with ourselves are not ones of identity, rather, they must be relationships of differentiation, of creation, of innovation. To be the same is really boring. We must not exclude identity if people find their pleasure through this identity, but we must not think of this identity as an ethical universal rule.","source":"Michel Foucault, “Sex, Power, and the

Spaces then become accessible only to those who are<br/>\nfamiliar with, and able to express themselves with the proper language and adhere to the dominant customs. Participation in the discourse which shapes and directs this language and customs is mostly up to those who are able to spend too much time debating on activist blogs, or who are academics or professionals well versed in the dialect. As mentioned previously, the containment of radical discourse to the university further insulates the “activist bubble” and subcultural ghetto.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to creating spaces that are alienating to those outside of our milieu, anti-oppression discourse, call-out culture, and the related “communities” leads activists to perceive themselves as an “enlightened” section of the class (largely composed of academics, students, professionals, etc. who have worked on their shit and checked their privilege) who are tasked with acting as missionaries to the ignorant and unclean masses. This anarchist separatist orientation is problematic for any who believe in the possibility of mass liberatory social movements that are capable of actually transforming society…</p>\n\n<p>The retreat to subcultural bohemian enclaves and activist bubbles acknowledges that revolutionary change is impossible, and as a substitute offers a counterfeit new society in the here and now. We understand that such a proposition is appealing given the day-to-day indignity and suffering that is life under our current conditions, but time and time again we have seen these experiments implode<br/>\non themselves. Capitalism simply does not offer a way out and we must face this reality as the rest of the class that we are a part of faces it everyday. No amount of call-outs or privilege checking will make us into individuals untainted by the violent social relationships that permeate our reality.</p>","source":"With Allies Like These: Reflections on Privilege Reductionism,<i> Common Cause Ottawa</i><br/> (via <a href=\"https://leftclausewitz.tumblr.com/\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">leftclausewitz</a>)","reblog":{"tree_html":"","comment":"<p>With Allies Like These: Reflections on Privilege Reductionism,<i> Common Cause Ottawa</i><br> (via <a href=\"https://leftclausewitz.tumblr.com/\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">leftclausewitz</a>)</p>"},"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":true,"can_like":true,"can_reblog":true,"display_avatar":true},{"blog_name":"luxfoks","id":149333194716,"post_url":"https://luxfoks.tumblr.com/post/149333194716/disaster-communism-part-1-disaster-communities","slug":"disaster-communism-part-1-disaster-communities","type":"link","date":"2016-08-22 19:55:05 GMT","timestamp":1471895705,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"ktABiAlt","tags":[],"short_url":"https://tmblr.co/Z970Cy2B4yxVS","summary":"Disaster Communism Part 1 - Disaster Communities","recommended_source":null,"recommended_color":null,"followed":false,"highlighted":[],"liked":true,"note_count":71,"title":"Disaster Communism Part 1 - Disaster Communities","url":"https://libcom.org/blog/disaster-communism-part-1-disaster-communities-08052014","link_author":null,"excerpt":"In part one of this three-part article, we look at the concept of disaster communism as it relates to the communities of solidarity and mutual aid typically formed in disaster situations.","publisher":"libcom.org","description":"<p><a href=\"http://unbossed.tumblr.com/post/149333128178/disaster-communism-part-1-disaster-communities\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">unbossed</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><blockquote><p>Rebecca Solnit popularised the idea of disaster communities in her book <i>A Paradise Built in Hell</i>.

According to the 1775 Phips Proclamation in Massachusetts, King George II of Britain called for “subjects to embrace all opportunities of pursuing, captivating, killing and destroying all and every of the aforesaid Indians.”</p>\n<p>Colonists were paid for each Penobscot Native they killed – fifty pounds for adult male scalps, twenty-five for adult female scalps, and twenty for scalps of boys and girls under age twelve. These proclamations explicitly display the settlers’ “intent to kill”, a major indicator of genocidal acts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Native American genocide (including deaths caused by disease): 76 million</p>\n<p>etc. genocidal incidents involving native americans</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre\">Wounded knee Massacre</a>: 150-300</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears\">Trail Of Tears</a>: 5,000</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Creek_massacre\">Sand Creek Massacre</a>: 150</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnadenhutten_massacre\">Gnadenhutten Massacre</a>: 96</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War\">Creek War native casualties: </a>1,597</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ash_Hollow\">Ash Hollow Massacre:</a> 86</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Wiyot_massacre\">1860 Wiyot Massacre:</a> 188</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-navajolongwalk.html\">the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo</a>: (at least) 200</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Tongue_River\">Battle of Tongue River</a>: 50 </p>\n<p>that’s only a few, but notable, examples of forced relocation and massacres attributable to pre-modern genocidal policies, however modern (as in, post-19th century) <a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/05/powerful-video-documents-third-world-living-conditions-pine-ridge-reservation-159043\">includes unlivable reservation conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_of_Native_American_women\">forced sterilization of native women</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans#Americanization_and_assimilation_.281857.E2.80.931920.29\">forced assimilation policies in the 1920s</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_civil_rights#Indian_Civil_Rights_Act_.281968.29\">lack of constitutional rights pre-1968</a></p>\n<p>it goes without saying that this doesn’t do justice to the sheer amount of constant relocation, forced marches, and deportations faced by native americans, however.</p>\n<h2>U.S. foreign policy + CIA operations abroad</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program\">phoenix program</a> (1975), a program during the vietnam war meant to identify and neutralize suspected viet cong, viet cong sympathizers, and communists. it resulted in the torture of tens of thousands (by gang rape, rape following murder, whippings, electric shock treatment, and so on) and the “neutralization” of 81,740;

little bit late but here’s a concise and (hopefully) sufficient list of US crimes against humanity domestically and abroad</p>\n<h2>Native American Genocide</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cultural clashes between European settlers and Natives lasted for over four hundred years – small battles, large scale wars and forced labor systems on large estates, also known as encomiendas – took a large toll on the Native population.</p>\n<p>Throughout the Northeast, proclamations to create ‘redskins’, or scalps of Native Americans, were common during war and peace times. According to the 1775 Phips Proclamation in Massachusetts, King George II of Britain called for “subjects to embrace all opportunities of pursuing, captivating, killing and destroying all and every of the aforesaid Indians.”</p>\n<p>Colonists were paid for each Penobscot Native they killed – fifty pounds for adult male scalps, twenty-five for adult female scalps, and twenty for scalps of boys and girls under age twelve. These proclamations explicitly display the settlers’ “intent to kill”, a major indicator of genocidal acts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Native American genocide (including deaths caused by disease): 76 million</p>\n<p>etc. genocidal incidents involving native americans</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre\">Wounded knee Massacre</a>: 150-300</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears\">Trail Of Tears</a>: 5,000</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Creek_massacre\">Sand Creek Massacre</a>: 150</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnadenhutten_massacre\">Gnadenhutten Massacre</a>: 96</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War\">Creek War native casualties: </a>1,597</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ash_Hollow\">Ash Hollow Massacre:</a> 86</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Wiyot_massacre\">1860 Wiyot Massacre:</a> 188</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-navajolongwalk.html\">the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo</a>: (at least) 200</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Tongue_River\">Battle of Tongue River</a>: 50 </p>\n<p>that’s only a few, but notable, examples of forced relocation and massacres attributable to pre-modern genocidal policies, however modern (as in, post-19th century) <a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/05/powerful-video-documents-third-world-living-conditions-pine-ridge-reservation-159043\">includes unlivable reservation conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_of_Native_American_women\">forced sterilization of native women</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans#Americanization_and_assimilation_.281857.E2.80.931920.29\">forced assimilation policies in the 1920s</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_civil_rights#Indian_Civil_Rights_Act_.281968.29\">lack of constitutional rights pre-1968</a></p>\n<p>it goes without saying that this doesn’t do justice to the sheer amount of constant relocation, forced marches, and deportations faced by native americans, however.</p>\n<h2>U.S. foreign policy + CIA operations abroad</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program\">phoenix program</a> (1975), a program during the vietnam war meant to identify and neutralize suspected viet cong, viet cong sympathizers, and communists. it resulted in the torture of tens of thousands (by gang rape, rape following murder, whippings, electric shock treatment, and so on) and the “neutralization” of 81,740;

Asked about the bombing during Senate testimony, Deputy Chief of Mission Monteagle Stearns said,<b> “Well, we had all those planes sitting around and couldn’t just let them stay there with nothing to do.”\n\n</b><br></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\n\nThe refugees spoke of a relentless campaign of destruction: entire villages incinerated, temples and schools destroyed, livestock killed, people

crimes against humanity domestically and abroad</p>\n<h2>Native American Genocide</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cultural clashes between European settlers and Natives lasted for over four hundred years – small battles, large scale wars and forced labor systems on large estates, also known as encomiendas – took a large toll on the Native population.</p>\n<p>Throughout the Northeast, proclamations to create ‘redskins’, or scalps of Native Americans, were common during war and peace times. According to the 1775 Phips Proclamation in Massachusetts, King George II of Britain called for “subjects to embrace all opportunities of pursuing, captivating, killing and destroying all and every of the aforesaid Indians.”</p>\n<p>Colonists were paid for each Penobscot Native they killed – fifty pounds for adult male scalps, twenty-five for adult female scalps, and twenty for scalps of boys and girls under age twelve. These proclamations explicitly display the settlers’ “intent to kill”, a major indicator of genocidal acts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Native American genocide (including deaths caused by disease): 76 million</p>\n<p>etc. genocidal incidents involving native americans</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre\">Wounded knee Massacre</a>: 150-300</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears\">Trail Of Tears</a>: 5,000</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Creek_massacre\">Sand Creek Massacre</a>: 150</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnadenhutten_massacre\">Gnadenhutten Massacre</a>: 96</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War\">Creek War native casualties: </a>1,597</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ash_Hollow\">Ash Hollow Massacre:</a> 86</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Wiyot_massacre\">1860 Wiyot Massacre:</a> 188</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-navajolongwalk.html\">the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo</a>: (at least) 200</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Tongue_River\">Battle of Tongue River</a>: 50 </p>\n<p>that’s only a few, but notable, examples of forced relocation and massacres attributable to pre-modern genocidal policies, however modern (as in, post-19th century) <a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/05/powerful-video-documents-third-world-living-conditions-pine-ridge-reservation-159043\">includes unlivable reservation conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_of_Native_American_women\">forced sterilization of native women</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans#Americanization_and_assimilation_.281857.E2.80.931920.29\">forced assimilation policies in the 1920s</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_civil_rights#Indian_Civil_Rights_Act_.281968.29\">lack of constitutional rights pre-1968</a></p>\n<p>it goes without saying that this doesn’t do justice to the sheer amount of constant relocation, forced marches, and deportations faced by native americans, however.</p>\n<h2>U.S. foreign policy + CIA operations abroad</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program\">phoenix program</a> (1975), a program during the vietnam war meant to identify and neutralize suspected viet cong, viet cong sympathizers, and communists. it resulted in the torture of tens of thousands (by gang rape, rape following murder, whippings, electric shock treatment, and so on) and the “neutralization” of 81,740;

Asked about the bombing during Senate testimony, Deputy Chief of Mission Monteagle Stearns said,<b> “Well, we had all those planes sitting around and couldn’t just let them stay there with nothing to do.”\n\n</b><br></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\n\nThe refugees spoke of a relentless campaign of destruction: entire villages incinerated, temples and schools destroyed, livestock killed, people

would’ve framed cuba as a terrorist state.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\nThe desired resultant from the execution of this plan would be to place the United States in the apparent position of suffering

abroad</p>\n<h2>Native American Genocide</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cultural clashes between European settlers and Natives lasted for over four hundred years – small battles, large scale wars and forced labor systems on large estates, also known as encomiendas – took a large toll on the Native population.</p>\n<p>Throughout the Northeast, proclamations to create ‘redskins’, or scalps of Native Americans, were common during war and peace times. According to the 1775 Phips Proclamation in Massachusetts, King George II of Britain called for “subjects to embrace all opportunities of pursuing, captivating, killing and destroying all and every of the aforesaid Indians.”</p>\n<p>Colonists were paid for each Penobscot Native they killed – fifty pounds for adult male scalps, twenty-five for adult female scalps, and twenty for scalps of boys and girls under age twelve. These proclamations explicitly display the settlers’ “intent to kill”, a major indicator of genocidal acts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Native American genocide (including deaths caused by disease): 76 million</p>\n<p>etc. genocidal incidents involving native americans</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre\">Wounded knee Massacre</a>: 150-300</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears\">Trail Of Tears</a>: 5,000</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Creek_massacre\">Sand Creek Massacre</a>: 150</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnadenhutten_massacre\">Gnadenhutten Massacre</a>: 96</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War\">Creek War native casualties: </a>1,597</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ash_Hollow\">Ash Hollow Massacre:</a> 86</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Wiyot_massacre\">1860 Wiyot Massacre:</a> 188</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-navajolongwalk.html\">the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo</a>: (at least) 200</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Tongue_River\">Battle of Tongue River</a>: 50 </p>\n<p>that’s only a few, but notable, examples of forced relocation and massacres attributable to pre-modern genocidal policies, however modern (as in, post-19th century) <a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/05/powerful-video-documents-third-world-living-conditions-pine-ridge-reservation-159043\">includes unlivable reservation conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_of_Native_American_women\">forced sterilization of native women</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans#Americanization_and_assimilation_.281857.E2.80.931920.29\">forced assimilation policies in the 1920s</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_civil_rights#Indian_Civil_Rights_Act_.281968.29\">lack of constitutional rights pre-1968</a></p>\n<p>it goes without saying that this doesn’t do justice to the sheer amount of constant relocation, forced marches, and deportations faced by native americans, however.</p>\n<h2>U.S. foreign policy + CIA operations abroad</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program\">phoenix program</a> (1975), a program during the vietnam war meant to identify and neutralize suspected viet cong, viet cong sympathizers, and communists. it resulted in the torture of tens of thousands (by gang rape, rape following murder, whippings, electric shock treatment, and so on) and the “neutralization” of 81,740;

Asked about the bombing during Senate testimony, Deputy Chief of Mission Monteagle Stearns said,<b> “Well, we had all those planes sitting around and couldn’t just let them stay there with nothing to do.”\n\n</b><br /></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\n\nThe refugees spoke of a relentless campaign of destruction: entire villages incinerated, temples and schools destroyed, livestock killed, people

of african slave labor and oppression for hundreds of years, but i will. at least 85,000 deaths can be attributed to the transport of slaves alone (see: not abuses and deaths actually <i>within </i>the U.S.) and an unknown amount of slaves were killed within the U.S., however, in 1860 there were approximately 3,950,528 slaves, or 13% of the U.S. population. let that speak for

Today, it is just the other way around: our relationships with each other are determined by our relationships to things. Doing away with property wouldn’t mean you would lose your belongings; it would mean that no sheriff or stock market crash could take away the things you depend on. Instead of answering to bureaucracy, we would begin from human needs; instead of taking advantage of each other, we would pursue the advantages of interdependence.</p>\n\n<p>A scoundrel’s worst fear is a society without property—for without it, he will only get the respect he deserves. Without money, people are valued for what they contribute to others’ lives, not for what they can bribe others to do. Without profit, every effort must be its own reward, so there is no incentive for meaningless or destructive activity.

reviled and met with confusion for years), but understand the context. black feminist methodologies are far more expansive and complex than this example and i couldn’t possibly fit them all in one

Derrida the logic of Marx’s critique of ideology is one of exorcism, of summoning the ghosts of the old regime to appear before the tribunal of scientific socialism and to await the final judgement of history. Thus the opening lines of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, ‘[a] spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of communism’, designate a universal class whose experience of the antagonisms of capital has become increasingly independent of the powers of ideological representation. Consequently the spectres of the old regime - religious piety, patriotism, monarchism, militarism, racism - are mobilized against the impending transformation of wage labour into the politically self-conscious body of the proletariat. What the <i>Manifesto</i> demands therefore is an end to the repetitive power of spectres; for the fact that the material world, with all its variegations of suffering, has always been enchanted by ruling ideas, is a testament to the power of ideology to inhabit any exploitative regime.","source":"Ross Abbinnett, <em>Marxism After Modernity</em> (via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\"
